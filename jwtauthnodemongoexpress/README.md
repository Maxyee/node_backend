At first, I will describe for starting work on a express node and mongo project. We need three things to clear.

1. node should be installed into our machine
2. install express using npm package manager
3. install mongodb into the local machine 
4. implement mongo with the project.

## Process

In this section, I will describe how i make this project as well as how to start for a new node, express and mongo project.

We need to run some command into our bash step by step for starting or making our project.

Firstly, create a project directory and then navigate to that directory, you can follow this command for making a directory, otherwise
you can create it by your own.

I am describing what I besically do. At first, I opend my bash

`mkdir projectFloder`

then `cd projectFloder`

Now our directory is ready and we already staying on that folder. However, I need a package.json file where all of my package will 
be initialize what I am doing and what I am installing into my project.

For making that file just we need to run a command into our bash,

`npm init`

then the commandline will ask some question, we can answer those and submit `yes` on last line. This process will create a `package.json`
file

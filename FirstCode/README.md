## How to run first code in NodeJs
At the very beginning, we need to install nodejs into our local machine after that we can do the rest of the work.

After that, we need to open our terminal into this folder and then we just need to run a simple command for running this
`hello.js` file

Now just we need to write a simple commad

`node filename`

for this folder file name is `hello.js` so need to run

`node hello.js`

After running this command we will get the output from the code what we write before.

### output:

`Julhas Welcome to Node`

This is how we can run our nodejs file from terminal
